This script comes from https://github.com/rene0/xbox360/tree/master

It was uploaded 12 years ago and is now an archived repo; I downloaded it and made enough tweaks to get it to run under Python 3.

I do not know if I have introduced bugs in this process. I do not know how this works. I do know that I was able to run it on the game file for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and I got a successful dump of the files in the game. I am able to play the sound files, view some images, etc, so on the surface, it was a successful dump.

Again, all I did was tweak it to be valid Python3 code. I encourage anyone else who is interested to improve it and work out how it operates.
